/**
 * Lock a standalone page down to exactly what it uses.
 *
 * The point is not XSS — it is making "no network" enforceable instead of
 * merely intended. zxing-wasm ships a default `locateFile` pointing at
 * jsdelivr, and that string is compiled into the receiver even though
 * prepareZXingModule() overrides it. Today nothing reaches it; a library
 * upgrade or a reordered init is all it would take. `default-src 'none'` with
 * no http(s) source anywhere means the browser refuses rather than the page
 * quietly phoning home from an air-gapped machine.
 *
 * Standalone only, because the hosted site legitimately fetches its own
 * assets and a service worker, and that is a different (much longer) policy.
 *
 * Notes on the awkward parts:
 * - 'unsafe-inline' for scripts is unavoidable — the whole bundle IS an inline
 *   script. It costs nothing here: it cannot re-enable a network origin, which
 *   is the only thing this policy is defending.
 * - 'wasm-unsafe-eval' is REQUIRED or WebAssembly.instantiate is blocked
 *   outright once any CSP is present, and the decoder simply never starts.
 * - The wasm arrives as a data: URI that Emscripten fetches, so connect-src
 *   has to allow data:. The decode worker is a blob: URL.
 * - frame-ancestors, sandbox and report-uri are ignored in a <meta> policy and
 *   only earn a console warning, so they are left out.
